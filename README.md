# DroneLiveStream Backend

With [Amazon IVS](https://aws.amazon.com/ivs/) I built https://dronelive.stream, a simple website that generates a DJI compatible RTMP Stream URL and then displays the drone livestream.

Backend powered by AWS [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), and the [IVS SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aws-sdk/client-ivs)..
